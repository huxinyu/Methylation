# MADA: a web service for analyzing DNA methylation array data<br>
* MADA is developed for the whole process of methylation array data analysis, which covers preprocessing (loading data, quality control, filtering data, and normalization), batch effect correction, differential methylation probes analysis, differential methylation regions analysis, and downstream analysis. In addition, MADA provides a customization function for users to define their own workflows. Moreover, the visualization of preprocessing, batch effect correction, differential methylation analysis, gene ontology analysis, pathway analysis, and cluster analysis results are also supplied in MADA.<br>

* Use MADA online: [http://compubio.csu.edu.cn/MADA/](http://compubio.csu.edu.cn/MADA/)  <br>
